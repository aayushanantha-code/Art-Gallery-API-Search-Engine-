# cs1302-api

This was a project completed as part of a software engineering class taken at UGA. I used multiple APS's including the Harvard Art Gallery API to create a cataloge where users could enter preferences for the art and artifacts they wanted to see. Once requests were submitted, the articacts that matched their criteria were displayed in a slide show format.
