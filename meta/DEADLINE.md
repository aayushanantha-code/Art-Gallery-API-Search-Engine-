## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the
> the primary functions available to users of the app. Be sure to
> describe exactly what APIs you are using and how they are connected
> in a meaningful way.

> **Also, include the GitHub `https` URL to your repository.**

My application allows users to input an upper and lower bound of two years from which the Harvard Art Museum API returns link to artifacts dated from the time
    period. Each link is then quered into a link preview API which retuns a screenshot of the article page. The url to the page is also provided on the appliaction so
    they can visit the page if the screenshot of the page draws their eye. Users can use the back and next buttons to scroll between the pages/artifacts.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I learned how to query the response from one API to another and how to use tags on the URLs. I used such a tag for the API key for my link preview API.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

If I could start over I would try to add some extra functionality to the project such as a progress bar or modify the application so it displays not just artifacts,
    but signifcant people or gallerys or any of the many fields the Hardvard Art Museum API is capable of providing..
